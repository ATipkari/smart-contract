Solidity Practice with Hardhat

Welcome to my Solidity Practice repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing Solidity smart contracts and exploring blockchain development using the Hardhat framework. It includes multiple smart contracts, tests, and configurations that I've developed as part of my learning journey in Ethereum and smart contract development.

üöÄ Features
Solidity Smart Contracts: Learn the fundamentals of Solidity through practical implementations.
Hardhat Framework: Utilizing Hardhat to compile, deploy, and test Solidity contracts locally on a simulated blockchain.
Testing: Automated tests using Hardhat's testing environment to ensure correctness and security of contracts.
Local Blockchain: Interact with a personal Ethereum node running locally for testing and contract deployment.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Solidity: A programming language for writing smart contracts.
Hardhat: A development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing Solidity contracts.
Ethereum: The blockchain platform where Solidity contracts are deployed.
Ganache: Hardhat uses an in-memory blockchain for local testing and contract execution.
Web3.js: Interacting with smart contracts from JavaScript.
